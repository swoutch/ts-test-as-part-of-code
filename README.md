# Typescript project with tests files colocated with source files

Example of typescript app/lib project with tests colocated with source files.

The test runner is mocha because it's faster than jest or vitest.
tsx (TypeScript eXecute) is used to run ts files because it's faster than ts-node.

Tested with node v18.16.0 on a arm64 mac.
